# AI-Driven-Threat-Intelligence-Watch-System
Privacy-focused ML system analyzing personal digital footprint data to detect vulnerabilities, integrating an embedded watch for real-time alerts, and exploring OSINT techniques on personal datasets for learning and optimization.


A privacy-conscious system that uses machine learning to analyze personal digital footprint data for potential vulnerabilities. The system integrates an embedded watch to deliver real-time alerts and explores resource-efficient AI architectures for constrained devices. This project also experiments with OSINT techniques on personal datasets as a learning sandbox.

Features

ML-based threat detection on personal datasets (face data only)

Real-time alerting via an embedded watch device

Optimization of system architecture for low-resource hardware

Ethical and privacy-aware experimentation with OSINT techniques

Tech Stack

Programming Languages: Python, C

Frameworks / Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn

Embedded: ESP32, LVGL

Systems: Linux (user-level operations)

Other Tools: Git, Nextcloud (for testing & file interface)
